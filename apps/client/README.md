# apps/client

Next.js mobile-first client application.

Initial responsibilities:
1. Video player page with subtitle overlay lanes.
2. Dictionary hover/tap panel.
3. Profile setup and "Start New Game" flow.
4. Game scene UI with Tong assistant chat panel.

Implementation rule:
- Use shared contracts from `packages/contracts` and mocked data first.
