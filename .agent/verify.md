# Verification

Before claiming completion, run the evidence command and attach the manifest.

```bash
scripts/agent-evidence
```

Optional lanes are opt-in:

```bash
scripts/agent-evidence --e2e
scripts/agent-evidence --only=lint,type-check
# If wrapped in npm, pass flags after `--`: npm run agent:evidence -- --e2e
```

Validation lanes discovered:

- No standard validation command was detected. Fill this in manually.

Deploy contract:

- `.agent/deploy.yaml` records provider-neutral deploy and infrastructure gates.
- Deploy, rollback, and infrastructure apply lanes require trusted context and human approval.
- `scripts/agent-evidence` does not execute secret-bearing deploy commands.
- `infra/vm/verify.sh` is the reusable trusted-VM health and hardening check.

Exit taxonomy:

- `0`: required validation passed
- `1`: required validation failed
- `2`: blocked by missing dependency or environment setup
- `3`: blocked by missing auth/secret or subscription/browser state
- `4`: blocked by required human decision
